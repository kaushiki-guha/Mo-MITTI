## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#388E3C) to represent growth and health in agriculture. This evokes the natural world.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a desaturated and bright tone. This produces a soft and calming contrast to the primary color.
- Accent color: Burnt orange (#D35400) to highlight key actions and important alerts. It contrasts with the green to draw the user's eye.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headers and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clear, visually intuitive icons representing different farming actions and types of data.
- Maintain a clean and well-organized layout that is easy to navigate. Use of whitespace is maximized, as is readability.
- Incorporate subtle loading spinners and feedback animations to confirm interactions.
